# TODOS

## Implement the session-TTL cleanup job
- **What:** a periodic task that enforces `settings.session_ttl_days` — delete expired rows from `counselle.sessions` and their checkpoint data (by `thread_id`) from the LangGraph checkpointer tables.
- **Why:** the Settings surface ships the knob (ADR 0019 names retention as configurable) but nothing executes it; with the keep-everything default this is harmless for months, but a knob connected to nothing is config-surface debt.
- **Pros:** config honesty; disk hygiene before it's ever a problem.
- **Cons:** touches the checkpointer's internal tables (small coupling to library internals — re-verify table names on library upgrades).
- **Context (start here):** lives next to the reconciler interval task in the API lifespan (`api/main.py`); the deletion is two statements inside one transaction; add a `cleanup: {last_run, deleted}` line to `/v1/health`.
- **Depends on / blocked by:** Phase 4 checkpointer landed (tables exist in `counselle.*` per eng-review D3).
- *(Logged from /plan-eng-review, 2026-06-10. Note: CI pipeline was proposed and explicitly declined by the user the same day.)*

## B2: parked-then-non-resume ghost (turn lifecycle)
- A parked thread whose next action is NOT a resume (e.g. a cancel racing in) can leave the parked record ghosted — B2's turn registry single-flight lock owns concurrent-turn lifecycle; do not guard piecemeal. *(Logged from B1b review fixes, 2026-06-13; see the `# B2:` comment in `app/run_turn.py`.)*

## B2: `_write_failure_record` double-failure corner
- If the failure write itself dies after the prose append lands but before the record write, prose exists without a record — same B2 owner as above. *(Logged from B1b review fixes, 2026-06-13; see the docstring note in `app/run_turn.py::_write_failure_record`.)*

## sessions-list load-more (deferred from B5c)
- **What:** the sidebar sessions list (`GET /v1/sessions`) requests `limit=50` (the route's `le=50` cap) and treats that as the full list. Sessions beyond the 50 most-recent are not shown; there is no infinite-scroll / load-more / cursor pagination yet.
- **Why:** the route already returns a `next_cursor`; the FE just doesn't consume it. KISS for MVP2 — 50 covers the dogfooding window. Client-side grouping + search still work over the loaded 50.
- **Context (start here):** `src/api/http/sessions.ts` (`listSessions`, `SESSIONS_LIMIT`), `src/api/hooks.ts` (`useChatsQuery`), `Conversations.tsx` (`loadMoreConversations` is a no-op in `ConversationsSection.tsx`). Wire `next_cursor` → an infinite query and feed `loadMoreConversations`.

## Server-header CSP (deferred from FE-M9, Phase 6 / deploy)
- **What:** ship a real Content-Security-Policy as a response header from the server/CDN, including a `script-src` with a per-request nonce (and the other directives — `default-src`, `style-src`, `connect-src`, `font-src`, `frame-ancestors`, etc.). The stopgap `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">` now in `frontend/index.html` (FE-M9) covers only `img-src`/`object-src`/`frame-src`/`base-uri` and deliberately omits `script-src` (a meta-tag `script-src` breaks Vite's HMR inline bootstrap in dev).
- **Why:** the meta-tag CSP is a dev-safe backstop, not the control. A `script-src` is the real XSS mitigation, and a nonce-based policy can only be set as a response header at request time — it can't live in static `index.html`. Also pairs with the rest of the security header set (HSTS, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`).
- **Context (start here):** the stopgap meta lives in `frontend/index.html`; the production serving layer is the deploy target (see `docs/DEPLOY.md` — SPA same-origin serving / `--forwarded-allow-ips`). Once a server/CDN serves the SPA, set the full CSP + security headers there and drop or downgrade the meta tag. With FE-H1 landed there is NO Google-favicon origin to whitelist in `img-src`; a first-party favicon proxy (if ever built) would add its own origin.
- **Residual third-party favicon fetch — `schoolLogo.ts` (Phase 6, CFG-04):** `frontend/src/components/cards/schoolLogo.ts` still builds a `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=…` URL as the keyless school-logo fallback (the `logoCandidates` chain). This is the SAME privacy class as FE-H1 (leaks which school host the student views) but a DIFFERENT surface — school-card logos, not the citation/source-browsing path FE-H1 closed. FE-H1 (Phase 4) deliberately scoped itself to `SourceFavicon.tsx` and left this here. **Phase 6 must address it:** route it through a first-party favicon proxy or remove the Google fallback (the latter regresses school-card logos, so the proxy is preferred). Until then `img-src` in any CSP must still whitelist `www.google.com`. (Logged from FE-H1 reviewer carve-out, Phase 4.)
- *(Logged from FE-M9, Phase 4. The server-header CSP is the real control; the meta tag is defense-in-depth only.)*

## Sources/artifact panel per-trigger focus restore (deferred from FE-M8, Phase 4)
- **What:** on closing the right-rail panel (sources/artifact), return focus to the exact trigger that opened it (the inline pill or the SourcesStrip button), not just the chat region. Phase 4 ships the contained fix: focus moves to the panel heading on open, and on close moves to `<main role="main">` (given `tabIndex={-1}` in `ChatView.tsx`) so AT focus isn't stranded on the unmounted panel. True per-trigger restore needs the opening element captured at open time.
- **Why:** the panel is opened via a jotai atom (`openSourcesPanelAtom`/`openArtifactPanelAtom`) from many call sites (inline pills in `MessageContent.tsx`, the strip in `SourcesStrip.tsx`), so the trigger element isn't known at the close site without storing it. Storing a DOM node in atom state couples DOM into app state — deferred rather than done dirtily.
- **Context (start here):** `src/app/ChatView.tsx` (`closeSources`/`closeArtifact`, `mainRef`), `src/app/state.ts` (the open atoms), `src/components/citations/SourcesPanel.tsx` (`headingRef` mount-focus). Also: focus-restore-on-close is hard to assert in jsdom — cover it with Playwright in Phase 7.
- *(Logged from FE-M8, Phase 4. The contained main-focus fix is in; per-trigger restore is the follow-up.)*

## Community card viz type (deferred from MVP1)
- **What:** implement the `community_card` type in `RenderSpec` and the corresponding frontend card renderer for qualitative/Reddit content.
- **Why:** the architecture designed it (ARCHITECTURE §17) but it was not built in MVP1 — `RenderSpec.type` currently accepts only `stat_block | comparison_table`. Community/Reddit content falls back to prose narration in the delta stream.
- **Context:** see `domain/specs.py` (`RenderSpec`) and ARCHITECTURE §17. No honesty risk deferred — community content is never quantified anyway; this is a UX improvement only.
- *(Logged from Phase 7 Slice D docs audit, 2026-06-11.)*
